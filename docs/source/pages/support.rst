Note::

    If you want to understand how Metaheuristic is applied to Functional Link Neural Network, you need to read the paper
	titled "A resource usage prediction system using functional-link and genetic algorithm neural network for multivariate cloud metrics".
	The paper can be accessed at the following `this link <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.063>`_


Please include these citations if you plan to use this library::
